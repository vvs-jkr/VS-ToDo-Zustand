- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Zustand**: A lightweight and flexible state management library for React.
- **Vite**: A blazing-fast frontend build tool.
- **TypeScript**: A programming language that extends JavaScript capabilities.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in code.
- **Sass**: A CSS preprocessor for more convenient styling.
